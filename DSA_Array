What is Array?

The array is a fixed-size sequenced collection of variables belonging to the same data types. The array has adjacent 
memory locations to store values. Since the array provides a convenient structure for representing data, it falls under 
the category of the data structures in C. The syntax for declaring array are:
data_type array_name [array_size];

Following are the essential terminologies used for understanding the concepts of Arrays:
Element: Every item stored in an array is termed as an element
Index: each memory location of an element in an array is denoted by a numerical index which is used for identifying the element

When a program works with many variables which hold comparable forms of data, then organizational and managerial difficulty 
quickly arise. If you are not using arrays, then the number of variables used will increase. Using the array, the number of 
variables reduces, i.e., you can use a single name for multiple values, you need to deal with its index values (starting from 0 
to n).

Basic Operations-

There is some specific operation that can be performed or those that are supported by the array. 
These are:
1.Traversing: It prints all the array elements one after another.
2.Inserting: It adds an element at given index.
3.Deleting: It is used to delete an element at given index.
4.Searching: It searches for an element(s) using given index or by value.
5.Updating: It is used to update an element at given index.
